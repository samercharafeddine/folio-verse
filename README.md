> A website for creating an immersive 3D portfolio, making it easier for non tech people to create a customizable 3D portfolio.
>
> Folioverse aims to streamline the immersive portfolio making process by providing a user-friendly platform for users to add their own 3D models or the pre-existing ones and unleash their creativity on the sandbox. We believe in enhancing the portfolio experience by saving time and ensuring user satisfaction.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want a landing page that introduces me to the concept of interactive 3D portfolios so that i can understand what i can benefit from using this platform.
- As a user, I want an easy to use UI so that i can customize and build easily my portfolio.
- As a user, I want to be able to add my own 3D models so that i can be unique and different from any other user.
- As a user, I want to be able to add minigames so that my visitors can stay a bit longer on my portfolio and create a lasting memory.
- As a user, I want to be able to know how many users are viewing my portfolio so that i know how it is performing.
- As a user, I want others to be able to contact me so that if a recruiter saw my portfolio heâ€™ll be able to reach me easily.

> We designed Coffee Express using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

### Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
